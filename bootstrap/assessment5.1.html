        <i> <p>  Out of the eight biogeographic realms on earth, Bhutan straddles two major biogeographic realms, the Indo-Malayan realm consisting of the lowland rain forests of South and Southeast Asia and the Pale-arctic realm consisting of conifer forests and alpine meadows of northern Asia and Europe. The country is home to 200 species of mammals, 770 species of birds and 119 species of Herpetofauna which is still being researched, studied and documented.

      Like any other developing country, Bhutan is also on the racing track of economic development. According to Asian Development Bank (ADB) report Bhutan’s growth was projected to accelerate 9.9% in 2018 from the 8.2% increase in 2017. Development activities encroaching into natural forests, prime wildlife habitats and their migratory routes pose immediate threats to wildlife and their habitats, particularly in triggering habitat fragmentation and degradation. Besides habitat fragmentation, illegal wildlife trade and human wildlife conflict are the key threats facing wildlife conservation in Bhutan. Poaching and illegal wildlife trade is on the rise and human wild life conflicts are escalating.

      This wildlife practice strategy takes a holistic approach in delivering the output that will contribute to the Global Wildlife Practice goals through two high impact initiatives (HIIs)- doubling tigers number by 2022 and securing 20 Snow leopard landscapes by 2020 besides contributing to the WWF Bhutan’s conservation strategy, Milestone of Bhutan for Life, national biodiversity action plan of Bhutan and the 12th five-year plan of Bhutan.
      <br><br>
      Wildlife species of ecological and cultural importance are adequately protected and managed to sustain a viable population
      that are resilient to climate change.</p></i>
