    The dzongs in Bhutan serve several purposes. The two main purposes that these dzongs serve are administrative and religious purposes. A part of the building is dedicated for the administrative purposes and a part of the building to the monks for religious purposes. Generally, this distinction is made within the same room from where both administrative and religious activities are conducted. There is separate accommodation for the temple monk's adjacent to the main building. The construction of the dzong is such that there is a huge tower in the centre which is surrounded by a rectangle complex. The whole complex looks extremely stunning amidst the high mountain ranges of Bhutan.

    <b><h2><q>Trongsa Dzong is certainly the most famous dzongs in Bhutan. It is the largest fortress in Bhutan but that's not what makes it so important. Trongsa Dzong is located in the Trongsa district which is precisely the centre of the country. Due to its important location, Trongsa Dzong is an administrative as well as the religious spot for the country.</h2></q></b>

As Dzongs are the significance of both administrative and religious activities, Trongsa Dzong has long been the official headquarter building of the Trongsa government from where most of its official work is carried out. It is also a monastic complex and home to as much as 200 monks living together in the complex. 


The location of Trongsa Dzong is not only considered vital because of its central coverage but the scenic landscapes that around this prestigious edifice as equally important. It is located on the ridge of the mountain with the fiercely flowing Mangde river on its banks. In the backdrop, you can witness the black Himalayan ranges in the southwest.
One of the most eminent monasteries and teaching school, Paro Dzong is located in the Paro District of Bhutan. It is also known as Rinpung Dzong and is one of the most famous dzongs in Bhutan. Paro district is considered one of the most scenic of the country and an attraction for the travellers and Buddhist scholars.

It is located on the banks of the Paro Chhu river and is accessible by a small bridge. The complex of the dzong is not just a monastery but also the Kagyu school which belongs to the Drukpa ancestral lineage. It is also the official space for the government of Paro district for all their administrative purposes.

<mark>
The Paro Dzong is known for its celebration of Parp Tshechu, the great annual festival of Bhutan. It is celebrated in the complex of Paro Dzong where the holy figure Padmasambhava is worshipped and various traditional dances are performed to mark the celebration of the festival.</mark>

Although the construction of these fortresses spread across different era, Dzongs that were particularly built in the 17th century played a significant role in the history of Bhutan. Bhutan prior to the 17th century was known to be a divisive with many local kings and chieftains. The sense of solidarity first prevailed in the region on the arrival of the prophesied leader from Tibet which was marked by a proliferation of the construction of Dzongs across the country. These Dzongs were subsequently used as military bases and as an armory to fight against the Tibetan invasions from the north and the British-Indian attacks from the south. Travelers may notice that most of these fortresses are built on a ridge or on a hill overlooking the valley. Susceptible to frequent external invasion, the fortresses built on higher elevation provided a strategic defensive position against these attacks.

Aside from its military role, the Dzongs also housed the administrative and monk bodies and its large open courtyard were designated as areas where people would congregate to celebrate festivals. The tradition is continued today as Tashicho Dzong in Thimphu houses the throne room, the secretariat and offices of the King of Bhutan. It also serves as the summer residence for the Central Monastic Body. Today the Dzongs also 
house many religious and historical artifacts of great value to the nation.
